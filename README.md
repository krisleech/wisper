* Decouple core business logic from external concerns in Hexagonal style architectures
* Use as an alternative to ActiveRecord callbacks and Observers in Rails apps
* Connect objects based on context without permanence
* React to events synchronously or asynchronously

Note: Wisper was originally extracted from a Rails codebase but is not dependant on Rails.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'wisper', '2.0.0.rc1'
```

## Usage

Any class with the `Wisper::Publisher` module included can broadcast events
to subscribed listeners. Listeners subscribe, at runtime, to the publisher.

### Publishing

```ruby
# Publish from an instance
class CancelOrder
  include Wisper::Publisher

  def call(order_id)
    order = Order.find_by_id(order_id)

    # business logic...

    if order.cancelled?
      broadcast(:cancel_order_successful, order.id)
    else
      broadcast(:cancel_order_failed, order.id)
    end
  end
end

# Or publish at the class level
class CRMService
  include Wisper::Publisher

  def self.add_user(attributes)
    # business logic...

    broadcast(:user_added_to_crm, attributes)
  end
end
```

When a publisher broadcasts an event it can include any number of arguments.

The `broadcast` method is also aliased as `publish`.

You can also include `Wisper.publisher` instead of `Wisper::Publisher`.

### Subscribing

#### Objects

Any object can be subscribed as a listener.

```ruby
cancel_order = CancelOrder.new

cancel_order.subscribe(OrderNotifier.new)

cancel_order.call(order_id)

# Subscribe at the class level
# This will receieve events from the class and instances
CRMService.subscribe(MetricsGatherer)
```

The listener would need to implement a method for every event it wishes to receive.

```ruby
class OrderNotifier
  def cancel_order_successful(order_id)
    order = Order.find_by_id(order_id)

    # notify someone ...    
  end
end
```

#### Blocks

Blocks can be subscribed to single events and can be chained.

```ruby
cancel_order = CancelOrder.new

cancel_order.on(:cancel_order_successful) { |order_id| ... }
            .on(:cancel_order_failed)     { |order_id| ... }

cancel_order.call(order_id)
```

You can also subscribe to multiple events using `on` by passing
additional events as arguments.

```ruby
cancel_order = CancelOrder.new

cancel_order.on(:cancel_order_successful) { |order_id| ... }
            .on(:cancel_order_failed,
                :cancel_order_invalid)    { |order_id| ... }

cancel_order.call(order_id)
```

Do not `return` from inside a subscribed block, due to the way
[Ruby treats blocks](http://product.reverb.com/2015/02/28/the-strange-case-of-wisper-and-ruby-blocks-behaving-like-procs/)
this will prevent any subsequent listeners having their events delivered.

### Handling Events Asynchronously

```ruby
cancel_order.subscribe(OrderNotifier.new, async: true)
```

Wisper has various adapters for asynchronous event handling, please refer to
[wisper-celluloid](https://github.com/krisleech/wisper-celluloid),
[wisper-sidekiq](https://github.com/krisleech/wisper-sidekiq),
[wisper-activejob](https://github.com/krisleech/wisper-activejob), or
[wisper-que](https://github.com/joevandyk/wisper-que).

Depending on the adapter used the listener may need to be a class instead of an object. In this situation, every method corresponding to events should be declared as a class method, too. For example:

```ruby
class OrderNotifier
  # declare a class method if you are subscribing the listener class instead of its instance like:
  #   cancel_order.subscribe(OrderNotifier)
  #
  def self.cancel_order_successful(order_id)
    order = Order.find_by_id(order_id)

    # notify someone ...    
  end
end
```

### ActionController

```ruby
class CancelOrderController < ApplicationController

  def create
    cancel_order = CancelOrder.new

    cancel_order.subscribe(OrderMailer,        async: true)
    cancel_order.subscribe(ActivityRecorder,   async: true)
    cancel_order.subscribe(StatisticsRecorder, async: true)

    cancel_order.on(:cancel_order_successful) { |order_id| redirect_to order_path(order_id) }
    cancel_order.on(:cancel_order_failed)     { |order_id| render action: :new }

    cancel_order.call(order_id)
  end
end
```

### ActiveRecord

If you wish to publish directly from ActiveRecord models you can broadcast events from callbacks:

```ruby
class Order < ActiveRecord::Base
  include Wisper::Publisher

  after_commit     :publish_creation_successful, on: :create
  after_validation :publish_creation_failed,     on: :create

  private

  def publish_creation_successful
    broadcast(:order_creation_successful, self)
  end

  def publish_creation_failed
    broadcast(:order_creation_failed, self) if errors.any?
  end
end
```

There are more examples in the [Wiki](https://github.com/krisleech/wisper/wiki).

## Global Listeners

Global listeners receive all broadcast events which they can respond to.

This is useful for cross cutting concerns such as recording statistics, indexing, caching and logging.

```ruby
Wisper.subscribe(MyListener.new)
```

In a Rails app you might want to add your global listeners in an initalizer.

Global listeners are threadsafe.

### Scoping by publisher class

You might want to globally subscribe a listener to publishers with a certain
class.

```ruby
Wisper.subscribe(MyListener.new, scope: :MyPublisher)
Wisper.subscribe(MyListener.new, scope: MyPublisher)
Wisper.subscribe(MyListener.new, scope: "MyPublisher")
Wisper.subscribe(MyListener.new, scope: [:MyPublisher, :MyOtherPublisher])
```

This will subscribe the listener to all instances of the specified class(es) and their
subclasses.

Alternatively you can also do exactly the same with a publisher class itself:

```ruby
MyPublisher.subscribe(MyListener.new)
```

## Temporary Global Listeners

You can also globally subscribe listeners for the duration of a block.

```ruby
Wisper.subscribe(MyListener.new, OtherListener.new) do
  # do stuff
end
```

Any events broadcast within the block by any publisher will be sent to the
listeners.

This is useful for capturing events published by objects to which you do not have access in a given context.

Temporary Global Listeners are threadsafe.

## Subscribing to selected events

By default a listener will get notified of all events it can respond to. You
can limit which events a listener is notified of by passing a string, symbol,
array or regular expression to `on`:

```ruby
post_creator.subscribe(PusherListener.new, on: :create_post_successful)
```

## Prefixing broadcast events

If you would prefer listeners to receive events with a prefix, for example
`on`, you can do so by passing a string or symbol to `prefix:`.

```ruby
post_creator.subscribe(PusherListener.new, prefix: :on)
```

If `post_creator` were to broadcast the event `post_created` the subscribed
listeners would receive `on_post_created`. You can also pass `true` which will
use the default prefix, "on".

## Mapping an event to a different method

By default the method called on the listener is the same as the event
broadcast. However it can be mapped to a different method using `with:`.

```ruby
report_creator.subscribe(MailResponder.new, with: :successful)
```

This is pretty useless unless used in conjunction with `on:`, since all events
will get mapped to `:successful`. Instead you might do something like this:

```ruby
report_creator.subscribe(MailResponder.new, on:   :create_report_successful,
                                            with: :successful)
```

If you pass an array of events to `on:` each event will be mapped to the same
method when `with:` is specified. If you need to listen for select events
_and_ map each one to a different method subscribe the listener once for
each mapping:

```ruby
report_creator.subscribe(MailResponder.new, on:   :create_report_successful,
                                            with: :successful)

report_creator.subscribe(MailResponder.new, on:   :create_report_failed,
                                            with: :failed)
```

You could also alias the method within your listener, as such
`alias successful create_report_successful`.

## Testing

Testing matchers and stubs are in seperate gems.

### Clearing Global Listeners

If you use global listeners in non-feature tests you _might_ want to clear them
in a hook to prevent global subscriptions persisting between tests.

```ruby
after { Wisper.clear }
```
